Code explanation : I used MLP classifier, KNeighbors classifier, SVC(with baggingclassifier) with voting classifier. 
  Because those classifiers were efficient when I ran them. 
  And, voting classsifier is a good method to gather all the classifiers.
  I hope this code run more accurately than any others.
